This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

There is an npm shortcut in the Makefile so feel free to also use `make run`. 
Quality short cutcuts also added to the Makefile like `make lint`. 


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the color picker tool.
